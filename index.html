                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p >I'm an aspiring software engineer that is always eager to learn<br>
                    new things and work hard to achieve my goals. I really enjoy working<br>
                    with different systems and programs using them to create software<br>
                    of my own and to see what I am capable of.Programming is a big passion<br>
                    of mine and has continuously peeked my interest since learning my first<br>
                    "Hello World".</p>

                <p>I have worked with a lot of different languages including Java, Python,<br>
                    Using these languages I have created programs covering the<br>
                    fundamental concepts in programming. I have also dabbled in video game<br>
                    development using game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine creating<br>
                    small games that cover a lot of the fundamental concepts in video game<br>
                    development</p>

                <p>Aside from my love for everything computers I am really fond of the<br>
                    outdoors enjoying activities like hiking and gardening. I also find animals<br>
                    very interesting and like to care for them. From feeding insects, birds<br>
                    and lizards outside to caring for my "fierce" feline and multiple reptiles<br>
                    such as snakes and geckos.</p>
